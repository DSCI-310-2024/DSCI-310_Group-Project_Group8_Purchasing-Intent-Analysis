        "E-commerce pages host several customers at any given moment, yet its metric of success lies in the visitors who ultimately make purchase. This project uses several machine learning models to learn from webpage data and customer browsing behaviour in order to predict whether or not a given customer will finalize their purchase.\n",

        "It has been no surprise that retail giants like Walmart and Ikea have aggressively invested and developed their e-commerce experiences transitioning away from big box store fronts and converting those assets to hubs for location-based fulfillment @Monteros_2023. The post-pandemic affects on consumer behaviour have accelerated our dependency on digital platforms and have pushed the e-commerce industry to grow a whopping 25% to an industry worth over $4 trillion USD @Shaw_Eschenbrenner_Baier_2022. Consequently, online storefronts get a lot of site traffic but what ultimately matters is their decision to purchase and the volume of revenue. Marketing and User Experience teams are tasked with optimizing a site’s interface and content in order to improve customer retention and the site’s revenue. Given this, understanding customer browsing behaviour and web page features is crucial for not only improving the user’s experience, but also maximizing the retailer’s revenue. Traditionally marketing and user experience studies are conducted through surveys, interviews and ethnographic studies, taking weeks up to months to process. However, machine learning-based marketing research has exponentially reduced the rate at which web metrics and purchase conversion strategies can be processed, while significantly increasing purchase prediction accuracy @Gkikas2022. A common method to evaluate user retention for online web browsing is through clickstream data of the user’s navigation path, however Saka et al. found that combining this information with session information significantly improves the purchase success rate @Sakar_Polat_Katircioglu_Kastro_2018.\n",

Similarly, we know that the SVM model struggles with computational efficiency and that is what our results reflected in the the fit time. The random forests model came out on top of the efficiency tables with the quickest fit time and scoring time while outperforming all other models in terms of score as well.\n",

        "In assessing the accuracy of machine learning models, particularly in the context of comparing Random Forests, kNN, and SVM, it's essential to evaluate various metrics and considerations that provide an in-depth evaluation truly reflective of performance. Each of these models offers distinct approaches to classification and regression tasks, leading to variations in performance across different datasets and problem domains. In terms of our results, the clear winner is the random forest model. \n",

This analysis helps us tame our optimism and helps us insights into how well our model correctly identifies positive instances within the dataset, which is particularly crucial in scenarios with imbalanced classes. Understanding the nuances of class imbalances allows us to make informed decisions about model adjustments, such as implementing techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights, to improve the model's predictive capability for minority classes. Moreover, it underscores the importance of considering multiple evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of model effectiveness and guiding future iterations or refinements to enhance predictive performance across all classes.\n",

        "Our results are purely based on the models that we chose to test, and therefore, may not be the absolute best off the shelf models for the given project but in favour of simplicity and the essence of time, among the 3 tested models (KNN, SVM and RF), we've concluded that the random forests model performed the best. \n",
        "\n",
        "While it was the best-performing model, the final model's precision score of 56% indicates that the model only predicts the positive class correctly roughly half the time. This could be indicative that the model was quite overfitted on the training model, or that despite the randomization of our train-test split, the training sample was not a good representation of the test split and perhaps the true population of online shoppers sampled in our dataset. Likely, the low precision score is highly influenced by the fact that there was class imbalance in our dataset, as demonstrated in @fig-revenue-distribution, which shows that there are over 4 times more false cases than true for the feature Revenue. As a consequence, the models, no matter how well they perform on the training dataset, are bound to better learn the predictive features for a false Revenue case than a true revenue case simply because of the class distribution in the original dataset. \n",
